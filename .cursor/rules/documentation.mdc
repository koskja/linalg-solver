# Documentation & Docstrings

These rules govern how the codebase should be documented.

## 1. Python Docstrings
- **Public Methods**: Document all public methods with docstrings.
- **Mathematical Notation**: Include appropriate mathematical notation (LaTeX-style) in docstrings where relevant.
- **Usage Examples**: Provide usage examples for complex operations.
- **Algorithm Details**: Explain algorithm choices and complexity within the documentation.

## 2. General Documentation
- Maintain clarity in naming and structure to complement the written documentation.
